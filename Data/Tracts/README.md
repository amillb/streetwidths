Download the [500,000 (national) shapefile under Census
Tracts](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2019/shp/cb_2019_us_all_500k.zip)
from the U.S. Census Bureau's [2019 Cartographic Boundary
Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.2019.html)
and extract it here.

Make sure to move the census boundaries out of their parent folder. E.g. `cb_2019_us_tract_500k.shp` should be in the `Data/Tracts/` directory, not in a subfolder.
