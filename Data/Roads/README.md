For each state that your counties are in, download its .osm.pdf from  
[Geofabrik's United States of America
region](http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us.html), and put it here.

To set up Alameda, CA, for example, download [California's
.osm.pbf](http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/california-latest.osm.pbf)
and put it here.
