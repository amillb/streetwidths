For each county you want to run, create a folder with the county's name and
state code, and place the county's parcel boundary data into it as a Shapefile.

To set up Alameda, CA, for example, create a folder here named alameda_ca,
download the Shapefile from [Alameda County Parcel
Boundaries](https://data.acgov.org/datasets/b55c25ae04fc47fc9c188dbbfcd51192_0/explore?location=37.680082%2C-121.921590%2C10.80),
and extract the files into alameda_ca.
